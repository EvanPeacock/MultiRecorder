For each connected OBS instance, OBS Controller:
* Displays an inital screenshot
* Displays current framerate, resolution, and recording time
* Allows for stopping, starting, pausing, and unpausing of recording

Support for similarly remotely controlling Blackmagic HyperDeck products is planned.
